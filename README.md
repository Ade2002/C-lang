# int main

int main() this is beginning of the program It calls other functions

# printf()

printf() is a method for printing out instructions to the screen, console or whateever.

# \n

\n in c functions is a new line character for new lines so basically once the prinf method instructions runs its moves on to a new line and runs the next instructions.

# String

A string is composed of characters, each of which is printed exactly as it appears, To identify the start of the string, we put a doublequote (") at the front. To identify the end of the string we put another double-quote at the end.
So printf("xyz"); would simply print an x, then a y, and finally a z

if we want to actually print a double-quote? We can’t exactly put a double-quote in the middle of the string because it would be mistaken for the end-of-string marker. Double-quote is a special character. The normal print-what-you-see rules do not apply in C.

# backslash virgue \

Different languages take different approaches to this problem. Some require the special character to be entered twice. C uses backslash (virgule, \) as an escape character to change the meaning of the next character after it. Thus, to print a doublequote you type in backslash double-quote. To print a backslash, you must escape it by typing another backslash in front of it. The first backslash means “give the next character its alternate meaning.” The second backslash has an alternate meaning of “print a backslash.” Without a backslash, special characters have a natural special meaning. With a backslash they print as they appear

# variables

this are containers where we can store diff pieces of information, diff data values like numbers, texts, special characters, variables makes it easier for us to manage and keep tracks of all the data in our program.

# char

this is a short form for character, a keyword for storing string variables in C and for declaring the variable data type as string or letters

# arrays []

this is for storing multiples character in a variable example _char characterName[]_

# int

this is a short form for integer, a keyword for storing number variables in C and for declaring the variable data type as whole number only.

# double / float

keywords for storing decimal numbers as a variable in C and for declaring the variable data type as whole a decimal number only.

# const

this is a short form for constant, a keyword for storing blocks of constant variables in C before or after declaring the variable type. 

# format specifiers %d / %s / %f

this are placeholder for variables in c,each for integers, strings and decimals respectively.

# pow()

this is a mathematical method to calculate the value power of a given variable, it takes in two arguments separated by a coma.

# sqrt()

this is a mathematical method to calculate the value square root of a given variable, it takes in one argument.

# ceil()

this is a mathematical method to calculate the value of a given variable and round it up to the nearest integer, it takes in one argument.

# floor()

this is a mathematical method to calculate the value of a given variable and round it down to the nearest integer, it takes in one argument.
